The event will be a short presentation on the realities of implementing municipal plans from a private development perspective and how municipal policies impact building design, presented by MPlan students. Following this we will be joined by two members of the local ZZap Architecture + Planning Firm, Connor Wallace & Justine Bowles. These special guests will give a brief presentation on some of their projects, speaking to the ways that their designs have been adjusted and revised through planning policies and processes. The seminar will conclude with a Q&A session facilitated by Samantha Horner with opportunity for the audience to participate. 
 
The purpose of this session is to give planning students an opportunity to better understand how decisions and policies in the public sector impact private development. The seminar will include discussion on ideas like form-based codes, how policies impact the look and feel of buildings on our streets, and how do we, as planners, encourage good design through planning policies.
