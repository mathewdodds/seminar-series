#### Have you ever wondered about the role that Artificial Intelligence (AI) can have in urban planning? 

Join us for a Panel Discussion and Workshop on Urban Artificial Intelligence on April 11th, 11:15-12:15 pm ADT (virtual panel discussion) and/or 12:15-12:45 pm ADT (in-person workshop) to explore the ways in which AI is transforming our cities and shaping the future of urban life! 

Our event will start with a panel discussion with some of the brightest minds in the field, including Alex Lougheed from the City of Toronto and Marietta Le from MIT Department of Urban Studies and Planning, along with an opening message by Dr. Teresa Heffernan. They will guide us through the opportunities and challenges presented by AI, as well as some of the ethical and social implications of this rapidly advancing technology. 

Following, we will have a workshop where you will be able to explore different AI technologies and learn how they can be applied to real-world urban problems.
