On April 11th, we will be hosting a Panel Discussion and Workshop on Urban Artificial Intelligence, featuring some of the brightest minds in the field. Our panellists will include Teresa Heffernen, Tina Rajh, and Marietta Le, each bringing special wealth of knowledge and experience to the table.
  
During this event, we will explore the ways in which AI is transforming our cities and shaping the future of urban life. We will discuss the opportunities and challenges presented by AI, as well as the ethical and social implications of this rapidly advancing technology.
  
In addition to our panel discussion, we will also be hosting a hands-on workshop, where you will have the opportunity to engage with AI technologies and learn how they can be applied to real-world urban problems.
  
This event promises to be an exciting and thought-provoking experience, and I highly recommend that you attend. It will take place in the Richard Murray Design Building, Room 3105, at 11:15 and I guarantee that you will leave feeling inspired and informed.
