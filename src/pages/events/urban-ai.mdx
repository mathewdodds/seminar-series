Join us for an insightful panel discussion about the intersection of artificial intelligence and urban planning, and how it's changing the way we design and build our cities. Our expert panelists will delve into the ethical considerations, winners and losers, implications, best practices, and futures of AI in planning and design.

Marietta Le from MIT, Teresa Hefernan from SMU, and Alex Lougheed from the City of Toronto bring their diverse backgrounds and expertise to the table. Teresa will discuss the risk of perpetuating biases and exacerbating inequality through AI. Alex and Marietta will be our panelists and discuss how AI can transform our cities. As technology continues to advance, it's critical that we examine its impact on society and ensure that it's used for the greater good.

The panelists will explore the benefits and challenges of AI in urban planning, including the potential for increased efficiency and sustainability. They will also discuss real-world applications of AI in cities, from urban design to public safety.

Don't miss this opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of how AI is shaping the future of our urban landscape, and to hear from leading experts in the field. Register now for the Urban AI panel discussion and workshop!
