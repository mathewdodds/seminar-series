In the context of planning futures, planners have the power to achieve social goals through adopting incremental design approaches in urban design practice. Seminar attendants are expected to put in their best effort at engaging with community design in a way that much of the audience has not done before. While not all members need to share their thoughts, it is expected that at least one member from each group can report their findings or approach to the design charrette.
