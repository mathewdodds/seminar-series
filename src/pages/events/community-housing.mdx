As professionals concerned with human settlement, it is critical that planners understand the causes of inequitable housing outcomes and the tools that we have at our disposal to improve these outcomes. Being that approaches to addressing housing inequities often occur through the provision of non-market housing, this seminar will explore practical experiences in planning community housing initiatives and possible futures for the provision of community housing. We hope you will join us for an engaging panel discussion and Q&A with housing practitioners from throughout Canada.
